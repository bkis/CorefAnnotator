This plugin imports from arbitrary XML/TEI files. The entire textual 
content including the header is treated as the document text, i.e., 
everything not in tags will be in the document. All 
elements with the attribute 'ref' are treated as a mention. Exporting 
into TEI/XML only works when the document has been imported from 
TEI/XML before.

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

When importing from TEI/XML, several options can be specified:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Option</th><th>Default value</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Text root selector</td><td>empty</td><td>The CSS-like expression 
entered here can be used to select a portion of the XML document to be
extracted. To ignore the TEI header, <code>TEI > text</code> could be 
used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Language</td><td><code>x-unspecified</code></td>
<td>If a language is specified, the document will be marked with that 
language (this can be changed later). If left unspecified, the importer 
tries to extract an explicitly specified language from the document, by
looking for an element <code>langUsage[usage=100]</code>.</td>
</tr>
</table>
