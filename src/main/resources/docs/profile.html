<h1>Profiles</h1>

<h2>Usage scenario</h2>
<p>The exact annotation possibilities for an annotator depend on the annotation task. To support different kinds of annotation tasks, and to prevent annotation mistakes, a profile for the task can be created to disable some functions and enforce certain settings. Profiles are defined in an XML file called <code>profile.xml</code>. If this file is present in the same directory as an annotation file, it is loaded and activated.</p>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>Profiles can influence the following aspects of the annotation: Pre-defining entities and flags, disabling some or all user operations, change default values for all preferences, and provide information on the annotation guidelines.</p>
