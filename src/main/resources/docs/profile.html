<h1>Profiles</h1>

<h2>Usage scenario</h2>
<p>The exact annotation possibilities for an annotator depend on the annotation task. To support different kinds of annotation tasks, and to prevent annotation mistakes, a profile for the task can be created to disable some functions and enforce certain settings. Profiles are defined in an XML file called <code>profile.xml</code>. If this file is present in the same directory as an annotation file, it is loaded and activated.</p>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>
<p>Profiles can influence the following aspects of the annotation: Pre-defining entities and flags, disabling some or all user operations, change default values for all preferences, and provide information on the annotation guidelines.</p>

<h3>Predefining entities and flags</h3>

<h3>Blocking of operations</h3>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<code>&lt;guidelines url="http://example.com/guidelines-1.0" title="My guidelines" version="1.0" /&gt;</code>

<p>The above snippet demonstrates how to include a guideline link. The attribute <code>url</code> is mandatory, <code>title</code> and <code>version</code> are optional. The URL will be handed over to the system and opened by a browser. Thus any URL that a browser can open can be supplied here (most common are <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> links).</p>
