<h1>Flags</h1>

<p>Since version 1.8, it is possible to add custom flags that can 
be attached to mentions and entities. Flags are 
stored in the document.</p>

<h2>Flag Editor</h2>

<p>The flag editor can be opened via the <strong>tools</strong> menu. The 
editor shows a table with four columns, each row representing one flag. 
A flag is defined by four features (shown in the table from left to right):
</p>

<ol>
<li>Icon: Each flag is associated with an icon to help annotators to 
recognize it. The icon can be selected from the selection shown on 
<a href="http://aalmiray.github.io/ikonli/cheat-sheet-materialdesign.html">this
page</a>. It's recommended to search for a useful icon on the page, as 
it is much easier to compare and see.</li>
<li>Key: The key is used internally to link to the flags. Each 
annotation that is flagged stores this key. Initially, the key will be 
universally unique identifier (UUID), and it can remain this way. For 
merging and comparing, it is recommended to harmonize the keys in 
different files. If the key is changed, please note that it should still 
be <strong>unique</strong> within the document.</li>
<li>Label: The label is displayed in the menus and user interface. This 
is what the annotators see.</li>
<li>Target class: Flags can be associated with types of annotations. 
I.e., each flag can only be assigned to annotations of the kind 
specified here. There is currently no way of having flags applicable on
different annotation types, but it is not a problem to have multiple 
flags with the same label/icon and different target classes.</li>
</ol>
