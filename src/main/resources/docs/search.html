<h1>Search</h1>

<img src="screenshots/search-dialog.png" width="275" height="200"/>

<p>The search window can be activated by pressing <code>CMD/CTRL f</code>, or via the menu bar. 
After entering a few characters, search results start to appear below. 
The search results are organized as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context">keyword-in-context (KWIC)</a> list: 
The found string is shown in the center (and bold), accompanied by left and right context.</p>

<p>Individual findings can be selected with mouse and keyboard. 
If one or more finding is selected, the buttons on the left become active. They allow three operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add to existing entity: Adds all selected findings (without their context) to the entity 
that is selected in the tree of the main window.</li>
<li>Add to new entity: Creates a new entity and adds all selected findings to it.</li>
<li>Clear: Removes all findings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>The search interface can be used with regular expressions, making it very powerful. 
Regular expressions allow the definition of patterns involving some variability. 
They can become very complex, as the full range of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Java-based regular expressions</a> can be used.</p>

<p>As a quick reference, the following table contains the most important bits:
</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Symbol</th><th>Description</th><th>Example Expression</th><th>Example Findings</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>.</code></td><td>Matches any single symbol</td><td><code>d.g</code></td><td>"dog", "deg", "d g", ...</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><code>[ ]</code></td><td>Matches any of the characters in brackets alternatively</td><td><code>b[au]nk</code></td><td>"bank", "bunk"</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>[^ ]</code></td><td>Matches none of the characters in brackets</td><td><code>a[^bc]*d</code></td><td>"ad", "aefghd", "axd"</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>?</code></td><td>Makes the preceding character optional</td><td><code>s?he</code></td><td>"she", "he"</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>*</code></td><td>Matches the preceding character 0 or more times</td><td><code>dog*</code></td><td>"do", "dog", "dogg", "doggg", ...</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3>Example Expressions</h3>

<p>The following list shows a few examples that are useful for annotation purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\b[^a]+\b</code>: Find words that do not contain the letter "a"</li>
<li><code>\bdogs?\b</code>: Find singular and plural forms of the word "dog"</li>
<li><code>\b[A-Z][a-z]*\b</code>: Find words starting with upper case</li>
</ul>
