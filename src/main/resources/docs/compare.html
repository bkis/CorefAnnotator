<h1>Compare annotations</h1>
<p>The compare view allows the joined view of two (or more) annotated 
documents.</p>

<p>The compare view shows the document in text view, and the annotated 
mentions underlined. Colors, however, do <strong>not</strong> signal 
different entities, as in the regular annotation view. Instead, each 
annotator is represented by a color, and all annotations that are not 
in agreement are underlined by the annotators color. Annotated spans 
that are marked by all annotators are underlined in gray.</p>

<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The panel on the right shows settings and numbers about the agreement 
(see screenshot below). On the top, you find information about the 
currently used mode. Below that, each annotators is presented individually. 
On the bottom, you see some agreement statistics.</p>

<p>Information about annotators: For annotators, the view shows the number of 
annotated mentions and entities, as well as the position. Position is the last 
annotated mention (thus, it roughly corresponds to where in the document 
the annotator is).</p>

<p>Modes: In version 2.0, two comparison modes are supported: By default, the 
comparison only takes the span into account. I.e., two mentions are considered
equal, if they cover the same words, irrespective of the entity they refer to.
The alternative mode can be activated via the settings menu 
("Compare by entity name"). If activated, two mentions are only considered 
equal if they cover the same span and the names of the entities they refer to 
are also equal.</p>
