<h1>Preferences</h1>

CorefAnnotator can be customized a bit, using preferences. They are stored in the home directory of the computer the program is running on. This page documents and explains the customization options.

<h2>Setting preferences</h2>
<p>Most preferences can be set via the menu "Settings" in the menu bar. Some need to/can be set in a .ini file. Preferences are meant to be persistent.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Each preference is listed with their internal key (an all-caps string starting with <code>CFG_</code>), their their default value and a brief explanation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Behaviour<ul>
<li><code>CFG_CREATE_DEFAULT_FLAGS</code> (default: <code>false</code>). In older versions of CorefAnnotator flags were built into the program and not changeable. For coreference annotation, a few flags were pre-defined. If this is set to true, they are created automatically when a new document is created.</li>
<li><code>CFG_DELETE_EMPTY_ENTITIES</code> (default: <code>false</code>). If set to true, as soon as an entity is empty (i.e., doesn't have any mentions) it is removed.</li>
<li><code>CFG_FULL_TOKENS</code> (default: <code>true</code>). If true, annotated a new mention will automatically expand the selection so that the full token is annotated. A token, in this case, is delimited by whatever matches on <code>\\b</code> in a regular expression. This works mostly, but not always, to user satisfaction. If it doesn't (or you need sub-token annotations), you can always disable this on the fly -- the next mention will not be expanded.</li>
<li><code>CFG_TRIM_WHITESPACE</code> (default: <code>true</code>). Annotators do not always pay attention not to include a space character into their selection. If this setting is set to true, whitespace at the beginning or end of the selection is not included in the annotation.</li>
<li><code>CFG_ASK_BEFORE_FILE_OVERWRITE</code> (default: <code>true</code>). It's usually a good idea to ask users whether they want to overwrite a file on disk. This setting controls if that happens.</li>
<li><code>CFG_STICKY_FLAGS</code> (default: <code>false</code>). Flags attached to mentions are specific to each mention. If this setting is set to true, each flag operation (i.e., adding, deleting) is applied to all mentions with the same span (they do not have to belong to the same entity).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>User interface<ul>
<li><code>CFG_SHOW_TEXT_LABELS</code> (default: <code>true</code>). This setting controls whether flags in the tree view are shown as symbols only. If set to false, only the symbol is shown. By default, text and symbol are visible.</li>
<li><code>CFG_SHOW_TOC</code> (default: <code>true</code>). If the document contains segments (chapters, texts, or acts/scenes), they can be displayed as a table of contents. The TOC is shown to the left of the text.</li>
<li><code>CFG_SHOW_LINE_NUMBER_IN_TREE</code> (default: <code>true</code>). If the file has pre-defined line numbers, they can be displayed in the tree, along with each mention.</li>
<li><code>CFG_ENTITY_SORT_ORDER</code> (default: by number of mentions). Controls how to sort entities in the tree view. Alternatives are by number of mentions or alphabetically by label.</li>
<li><code>CFG_ENTITY_SORT_DESCENDING</code> (default: <code>true</code>). Sort direction.</li>
<li><code>CFG_KEEP_TREE_SORTED</code> (default: <code>true</code>). Normally, each newly inserted entity will be placed at the correct position in the tree -- the tree is always sorted according to <code>CFG_ENTITY_SORT_ORDER</code>. This setting turns the auto-sorting off.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compare view<ul>
<li><code>CFG_COMPARE_BY_ENTITY_NAME</code> (default: <code>true</code>). This setting controls how the compare view works. If true, two mentions are considered equal if they have the same extent and refer to an entity with the same name. If false, they are considered equal if they only have the same extent.</li>
<li><code>CFG_IGNORE_SINGLETONS_WHEN_COMPARING</code> (default: <code>true</code>). If true, singletons are not counted in the statistics view.</li>
<li><code>CFG_UNDERLINE_SINGLETONS_IN_GRAY</code> (default: <code>false</code>). If true, singletons are underlined in gray.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Non-boolean settings. These can only be changed via a preferences file.<ul>
<li><code>CFG_AUTOSAVE_TIMER</code> (default: 300000 ms = 5 min). The interval in which files are automatically saved. </li>
<li><code>CFG_SEARCH_RESULTS_CONTEXT</code> (default: 50). The number of characters to display left and right of search results.</li>
<li><code>CFG_MENTIONSURFACE_SEPARATOR</code> (default: |). The character to be used to separate the parts of discontinuous mentions.</li>
<li><code>CFG_ANNOTATOR_ID</code> (default: <code>Unknown annotator</code>). The label to be used for an annotator that has not been named.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
